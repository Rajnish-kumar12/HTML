<!-- In a block layout, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.
A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes, like English or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".
example== div,p etc.
-->


<!-- 
In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, replaced elements, and other inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them
into a stack of line boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each other vertically or
horizontally, depending on the writing mode. Typically, they are aligned by the baselines of their text. This can be
changed with CSS 
example== span,input etc.
